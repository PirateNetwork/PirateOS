Ghostship OS is the first version of the Pirate OS Lineup. This version concentrates mainly on wallet and user security. There is a need for a persistent USB Linux OS that is used only with pirate wallet allowing for an easy to use defence in financial privacy utilizing Pirate Chain Technology. You keep it in a safe location (with a backup of your Private Keys or of the drive after you’ve created key pairs) and only boot your computer to the GhostShip USB drive when you need to send ARRR. Arguably better than a hardware wallet or other options because when wieprz (the OS developer) is finished, it should be an easy to use boot device that covers security with things like VPS, MAC address spoofing, blocked ports to prevent scans while utilizing the best OS for this: Linux.In the next release of GhostShip, it will include encryption options when you shut down to prevent others from accessing the information. The goal of the Operating System is to protect the user from themselves. There is no shortage of people looking for simpler solution to protect themselves and their loved ones from criminal activity. With GhostShip there is no wallet data, no worrying about setting it up making it easier to secure new pirates and onboard them using GhostShip for the purpose of protecting them. Having our own environment to work on also gives us more options in the future for development. Hardware wallets, such as Trezor and other hardware solutions have security risks, which our OS mitigates. Here are a couple articles showing vulnerabilities in Hard Wallet solutions
